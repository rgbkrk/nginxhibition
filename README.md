nginxibition
============

Nginx can do a lot of neat things.

While trying to fix an issue on some production servers, I noticed some nginx features I never touch but were just begging to be played with.

Some ideas:

* Where am I :white_check_mark:
 * Return GeoJSON using the client's IP with the geoip module
* Implement the [HTCPCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol) in pure nginx conf

Things I must play with:

* Postgres for nginx
* Redis for nginx
* Memcached for nginx

Why do these things exist? Who knows, who cares? Now I can connect nginx to my database.
Forget applications, my nginx configuration *is* my app.
